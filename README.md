Abstract

This study investigates the properties of a potential companion to the central star of the Helix Nebula, inferred from observed variability in its light curve with a period of 2.792 days, utilising data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). Through spectral energy distribution (SED) analysis and light curve modelling, this research aims to delineate the companion temperature, radius, and orbital characteristics. Theoretical calculations have corroborated that a companion in this orbital period, at thermal equilibrium, must possess a temperature of at least 4,400 K. Initial assessments incorporated data for M, L, and T dwarfs within the SED framework, which, when combined with the central white dwarf data, surpassed observable limits, leading to their exclusion as viable candidates. 

Further investigation into a model of a K5 star, adhering to observational constraints, suggested a maximum companion radius of 0.107 solar radii (R☉), indicating a Jovian radius object to remain undetected within the SED. The utilisation of the LCURVE software refined the constraints on the companion radius and binary inclination, indicating a hot Jupiter-type exoplanet with a radius of 0.107 R☉ and an inclination of 1°. An alternative analysis, adopting a Gaussian distribution for inclinations in alignment with nebular inclination as suggested by Hillwig et al. (2016), identified an optimal companion radius of 0.023 R☉ at an inclination of 26°.

The preceding investigation effectively ruled out the possibility of the companion being a substellar dwarf or a white dwarf, as both would have been detectable within the SED and light curve data. The only remaining classification for the companion, given its equilibrium temperature of 4,400 K, is that of an exoplanet characterised as a large and intensely hot body, approximately three times the size of Earth. This study expands the understanding of exoplanetary companions to planetary nebula central stars by challenging existing planet formation and survival models amidst stellar evolution, comparing characteristics with analogous systems to discern patterns that refine predictions about planet formation and retention. Thereby, the study extends knowledge of planetary system diversity and resilience throughout the galaxy, illustrating the interconnectedness of planetary science and astrophysics in elucidating the mechanisms governing planet formation and survival under extreme conditions.
